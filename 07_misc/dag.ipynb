    "\n",
    "- **Nodes** = variables\n",
    "- **Directed edges (→)** = causal effects\n",
    "- **Acyclic** = you can't start at one node and come back to it by following arrows\n",

    "Example:\n",

    "Smoking → Lung Cancer\n",

    "Motivation affects **both** the cause and the outcome.\n",

    "This is called **confounding**, where Z is the confounder.\n",
    "\n",
    "So X and Y are **correlated** but there might not be **causation**\n",

    "Both X and Y affect Z.\n",

    "\n",
    "We do NOT want to condition on a collider Z because that makes X and Y look related even though they might not be"
