# Machine Learning Foundations

This repository is a learning-driven portfolio of machine learning and data science concepts, implemented through Jupyter notebooks.

I am a machine learning, data science and artificial intelligence student, and the main purpose of this repo is to support my learning process. I learn best by implementing concepts from scratch and this repository reflects that approach.

For recruiters: this repo is intended to demonstrate conceptual understanding, practical implementation, and progression over time, rather than polished production systems with flawless code.

## Notes on Style & Scope

- Emphasis is on clarity and learning, not minimal, optimized code.

- Many notebooks include explanations, visualizations, and intermediate steps.

## Status

- Actively maintained
- Continuously expanding as I learn new topics
- Focused on building strong fundamentals and intuition
